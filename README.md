# Portfolio

I took the initial code from [here](https://github.com/achris-alonzo30/github-portfolio) and then just personalized it into my liking. 
I liked the design so much, that I decided not to change many things, just add some things that I thought were nice to have. 

If you want to use anything that I've added, feel free to do so. 

Build with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind and Shadcn/ui.

You can see the live version [here]().

## How to run it
