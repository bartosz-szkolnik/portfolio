# Hello There

## General Kenobi!

Really? No, not really. Whilst building the React component to display this post I needed some mocked data 
to see how it'd look like in the browser. That's how the first post got named and I decided 
to leave it like that. After finishing the building process, I deleted most of the mock data 
and started to write this mockery of something you should be reading right now. 
But if you're still reading this, thank you. You can't really hear it, but I appreciate it very much. 
I'd buy you a coffee if we ever had the opportunity to meet up. 

## Memes

Oh, and the memes. I may not be the most fluent in those, but the ones I know, those I will reference in 
my writings. Why? There are many reasons to it, for example... Umm. Emm...

When you PvP, the primary thing you're gonna need is gear. Resilience gear. 
What? If you got this reference, hats off to you. If you don't, the link is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl1WP1YCiw0).
The real reason would be: why not right? This is my blog and I can write about anything I want. If you'd want to read a proper 
technical blog, I'd suggest reading somebody else's posts, e.g. [Kent C. Dodds's Blog](https://kentcdodds.com/blog). 
But if you don't mind a stupid reference here and there, I don't mind if you [stay while and listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAVVy_x3Erg), or at least continue to read. 

## Why is it so hard to choose a image for this post? 

This is my first time writing something like this... First time? I hope that 
you remember the "First Time?" meme. I won't put the image of the meme here, because 
I think that's too distracting for the reader. But if you really don't remember the meme, 
[here's an example](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/james-franco-first-time).

Back to the topic. Choosing a picture for even this stupid blog post can be 
difficult. I mean, you have so many good ones for different websites, 
e.g. [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). There are so many fantastic photos that 
you don't really know how to choose the correct one.

Apparently that's a real thing, when you have so many options 
to choose, you end up choosing nothing or just the thing you know will work. 
You know, I don't want to sound like I know a lot about this stuff. I just spent too many 
hours on the internet and I remembered some of the stuff, some of it I even consider 
somewhat valuable knowledge. 

So this phenomenon is called "Decision fatigue". If you want to know
more about it, here you can watch a [properly knowledgeable guy talk about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EbItW7r3-s). But if you're too lazy to read (or watch in this case), or as some say "tldw", you can just read the first comment under that video. 
Or you know what, I will even make it easier to you and paste it into here: "tldw: wear the same shirt everyday."

With which I totally agree with. I mean, not literally the same shirt, but just don't think about it too much. 
Open your drawer, pick the first shirt that sticks to you and (if it doesn't say anything racist on it) wear it.

## So why the cat picture?

Again I'm strolling off. You can say that this post has a image. This lovely image of a cat. And you may say, if I picked something like that 
then obviously it couldn't be that hard to choose from. Firstly, let's explain why I chose this. 

Back in the early days, sometime around 2013 or 2014, the internet wasn't as commercialized as it is today. 
And the common joke was that every website needed some cat pictures. Why? Apparently something around half the population are cat persons (the other half are dog persons [don't quote me on that]). 
And most people think cats are cute, so if your website had some pictures of some cats, people would want to visit your website more often. As valid of a reason as it gets right? 

One of the first books I've read about web development was [this one](https://ferrante.pl/books/html/). And the first thing that you see when you're starting to create a simple website (in chapter 2, chapter 1 just explains the fundamentals of html) is a picture of a cat.
So yeah, for me cats and web development are forever intertwined. 

Secondly, it wasn't so easy to choose. There is a million great cat pictures on the internet. To be honest I just chose the one that looked nice and was in the first or second row.
But I can imagine, if you're a person that really likes to "make a proper decision" and "see all the options", then the decision could prove quite difficult. 
Or maybe you don't have that, lucky you. 

## Wrapping up

I don't know whether even posting this is a good idea. I mean, what value does it add to anything? 
My main idea for this blog is to post stuff for my future self so if I ever get into a similar situation, I'll have something to remind myself that I've already been in such a situation and 
how I got out. But you may ask, why do I make it public? That's a valid question. And I can say that I have some similar notes to my future self that are private. 
But... if somebody ever finds this blog and they'll in similar situation to me, maybe some of the gibberish that I wrote will help them. 

You may sarcastically say: How altruistic. You got me here. That's a genuine reason, but I don't think I'm in any sort of place to be giving advice or web development or mental health issues.
Or maybe I am and I just don't feel like it. We'll see. 

But the second reason is... apparently it's a good thing to have a blog in today's difficult times of finding a job. So if I write some stuff about 
how to properly write some kind of component in a Next.js application, it'd look good for a potential recruiter. So, I thought to myself, why not? 

The third reason is, and I just thought of it, as Richard Feinman used to think (if I remember correctly, again don't quote me on that) the best way to memoize something is to explain it to someone. If you explained in a clear and understandable way and the person understood everything,
it means you know the topic so well, you can teach it. I don't really have anyone to teach them something, so I think I'll try to treat this blog as such. 

So yeah, I think that's enough for now. 

Oh, and this is supposed to be a somewhat technical blog so here you go. 
A very weird way to get the string "banana" in JavaScript.

```ts
console.log(('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase())
```

See ya!
